1) Git LFS doesnt allow proper garbage collection even if we deleted the file and no commits pointed to that file , 
Lfs wont allow for garbage collection leadingto taking up extra space

2) even if git can push push to remote storages it only pushes to git like storages no common object oriented dumb storages
Like Google cloud storage which doesnt know how to interact with git .

3) Where DVC can push and pull to anywhere no constraints .

4) DVC worries about what file produced what output from which data and versions them.

   Git doesnt cares about that and versions nothing.

5) DVC can handle pipelines and make the results reproducible , tracks experiments where git doesnt do that.
